- With Lambda@Edge, you can enrich your web applications by making them globally distributed and improving their performance - all with zero server administration.
- Lambda@Edge runs your code in reponse to events generated by the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network(CDN).
- Just upload your code to AWS Lambda, which takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability at an AWS location closest to your end user.
