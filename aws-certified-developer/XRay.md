# AWS X-Ray

![x-ray.png](./images/x-ray.png)
Helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture.  
With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your application's underlying components.
