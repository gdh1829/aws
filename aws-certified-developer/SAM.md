# SAM

## What is SAM?

- AWS Serverless Application Model(SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications.

- It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings.

- During deployment, SAM transforms and expands the SAM syntax into AWS Cloudformation syntax, enabling you to build serverless applications faster.
